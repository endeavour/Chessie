# A Tale of 3 Nightclubs

## Part Zero : 10:15 Saturday Night

We start by referencing Chessie and opening the ErrorHandling module and define a simple domain for nightclubs:

*)

#r "Chessie.dll"

open Chessie.ErrorHandling

type Sobriety = 
    | Sober
    | Tipsy
    | Drunk
    | Paralytic
    | Unconscious

type Gender = 
    | Male
    | Female

type Person = 
    { Gender : Gender
      Age : int
      Clothes : string Set
      Sobriety : Sobriety }

(**
Now we define some validation methods that all nightclubs will perform:
*)

module Club = 
    let checkAge (p : Person) = 
        if p.Age < 18 then fail "Too young!"
        elif p.Age > 40 then fail "Too old!"
        else ok p
    
    let checkClothes (p : Person) = 
        if p.Gender = Male && not (p.Clothes.Contains "Tie") then fail "Smarten up!"
        elif p.Gender = Female && p.Clothes.Contains "Trainers" then fail "Wear high heels"
        else ok p
    
    let checkSobriety (p : Person) = 
        match p.Sobriety with
        | Drunk | Paralytic | Unconscious -> fail "Sober up!"
        | _ -> ok p

## Part One : Clubbed to Death

Now let's compose some validation checks via syntactic sugar:
*)

module ClubbedToDeath =
    open Club
    
    let costToEnter p =
        trial {
            let! a = checkAge p
            let! b = checkClothes a
            let! c = checkSobriety b
            return 
                match c.Gender with
                | Female -> 0m
                | Male -> 5m
        }

(**
Let's see how the validation works in action:
*)

let Ken = { Person.Gender = Male; Age = 28; Clothes = set ["Tie"; "Shirt"]; Sobriety = Tipsy }
let Dave = { Person.Gender = Male; Age = 41; Clothes = set ["Tie"; "Jeans"]; Sobriety = Sober }
let Ruby = { Person.Gender = Female; Age = 25; Clothes = set ["High heels"]; Sobriety = Tipsy }

ClubbedToDeath.costToEnter Dave 
// [fsi:val it : Chessie.ErrorHandling.Result<decimal,string> = Bad ["Too old!"]]

ClubbedToDeath.costToEnter Ken
// [fsi:val it : Result<decimal,string> = Ok (5M,[])]

ClubbedToDeath.costToEnter Ruby
// [fsi:val it : Result<decimal,string> = Ok (0M,[])]

ClubbedToDeath.costToEnter { Ruby with Age = 17 } 
// [fsi:val it : Chessie.ErrorHandling.Result<decimal,string> = Bad ["Too young!"]]

(**
The thing to note here is how the Validations can be composed together in a computation expression.
The type system is making sure that failures flow through your computation in a safe manner.

## Part Two : Club Tropicana

Part One showed monadic composition, which from the perspective of Validation is *fail-fast*. That is, any failed check short-circuits subsequent checks. This nicely models nightclubs in the real world, as anyone who has dashed home for a pair of smart shoes and returned, only to be told that your tie does not pass muster, will attest.

But what about an ideal nightclub? One that tells you *everything* that is wrong with you.

Applicative functors to the rescue!

Let's compose some validation checks that accumulate failures :
*)

module ClubTropicana = 
    open Club

    let costToEnter p =
        trial {
            let a = checkAge p
            let b = checkClothes p
            let c = checkSobriety p

            let! result::_ =  [a;b;c] |> collect
            
            return 
                match result.Gender with
                | Female -> 0m
                | Male -> 7.5m
        }

(**
The usage is the same as above except that as a result we will get either a success or a list of accumulated error messages from all the checks. 

Dave tried the second nightclub after a few more drinks in the pub:
*)
    
let daveParalytic = { Person.Gender = Male; Age = 41; Clothes = set ["Tie"; "Shirt"]; Sobriety = Paralytic }

ClubTropicana.costToEnter daveParalytic
// val it : Result<decimal,string> = Error: Too old!
// Sober up!

(**
So, what have we done? Well, with a *tiny change* (and no changes to the individual checks themselves), we have completely changed the behaviour to accumulate all errors, rather than halting at the first sign of trouble. Imagine trying to do this using exceptions, with ten checks.

## Part Three : Gay bar

And for those wondering how to do this with a *very long list* of checks here is a solution:
*)

module GayBar = 
    open Club

    let checkGender (p : Person) = 
        if p.Gender = Male then ok p 
        else fail "Men Only"

    let costToEnter p =
        trial {
            let! result::_ =  
                [checkGender; checkAge; checkClothes; checkSobriety] 
                |> List.map(fun f -> f p)
                |> collect
            return 
                match result.Gender with
                | Female -> 0m
                | Male -> 7.5m
        }

(**
The usage is the same as above:
*)

let person = { Person.Gender = Male; Age = 59; Clothes = set ["Jeans"]; Sobriety = Paralytic }

let result : SimpleResult<decimal,string> = GayBar.costToEnter person
result
// val it : Result<decimal,string> = Error: Too old!
// Smarten up!
// Sober up!
